# Willa's SnackShop 
### Updated on 2024-07-12

This is a full-stack project featuring a .NET backend and React frontend, designed to cater to two distinct user roles. 

Firstly, it allows customers to view snack information, add items to their cart, and proceed to checkout. 

Secondly, it provides snack shop managers with tools to manage snack information, monitor and edit stock levels, and track sales. It also includes advanced charts that offer clear insights into profits and revenue from different snack items, enabling managers to make informed decisions.
